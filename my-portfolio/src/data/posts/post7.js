  excerpt: "How switching from plain CSS to Tailwind reshaped the way I build, design, and think about UI development.",
  html: `
    <p>When I first started styling websites, I stuck with plain CSS. Writing selectors, defining classes, and managing stylesheets felt natural, but the more projects I worked on, the more I realized how repetitive and messy it could get. A single button might need three or four class names, and I’d find myself scrolling through long CSS files just to tweak something small. Discovering Tailwind CSS was a game-changer. Instead of writing styles in a separate file, I could apply utility classes directly in my JSX or HTML. Suddenly, building a responsive layout was as simple as stacking utilities like flex, justify-between, gap-4, and p-6. It felt strange at first, almost like I was cramming too much into the class attribute, but once I got the hang of it, I realized it was way more efficient. Tailwind let me move faster, with less context switching between CSS and my components.</p>

    <p>What stood out the most for me was the balance between speed and flexibility. With plain CSS, I had complete control, but that also meant a lot of boilerplate. With Tailwind, I had a set of pre-defined, composable utilities that worked well for almost everything, but I could still extend it whenever I needed something custom. Tailwind’s approach to responsive design was also a relief. Instead of managing multiple media queries in a CSS file, I just dropped in md:, lg:, or xl: prefixes, and suddenly my layout adjusted at different breakpoints. It felt like Tailwind took the repetitive pain of CSS and packaged it into a system that respected developer time. The more I used it, the more I realized I was spending less time fighting with CSS and more time building features.</p>

    <p>Another interesting part of my experience has been seeing Tailwind evolve over time. I started when it was still relatively new, and now with Tailwind v4, the framework feels even more polished. The introduction of modern directives, like @layer, @apply, and @theme, gave me much more control over customization. Instead of scattering one-off classes everywhere, I could organize utilities and build design tokens that scaled with my project. The fact that v4 ships with more powerful defaults and better performance makes it even easier to recommend. It is almost like Tailwind grew up alongside me as a developer: when I was new, it felt like training wheels for styling, and now with v4, it feels like a professional-grade system for building consistent, scalable designs.</p>

    <p>Looking back, the transition from plain CSS to Tailwind didn’t just change how I wrote styles, it changed how I thought about UI development. Instead of treating design as a separate layer from logic, I now see it as an integrated part of building components. Tailwind gave me speed when I needed it, structure when projects grew, and flexibility when I wanted to break the rules. And watching it evolve to v4 with more directives and smarter defaults has been inspiring because it shows how even something as “simple” as styling can keep pushing forward. For me, Tailwind isn’t just a CSS framework; it’s become part of the way I think about front-end engineering.</p>
