  title: "From Raspberry Pi to Jetson Nano: How Edge Devices Are Powering the Future",
  excerpt: "Edge devices like Jetson Nano are redefining AI by bringing real-time intelligence closer to where data is created.",

    <p>The Jetson Nano is NVIDIA’s compact and affordable AI development board that brings the power of GPU computing to the edge. Unlike a regular Raspberry Pi that is more suited for general-purpose projects, the Jetson Nano is designed specifically for running machine learning models and handling heavy computer vision tasks. It comes with a quad-core ARM CPU and a 128-core Maxwell GPU, which allows it to run deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Caffe directly on the device. What this means in practice is that you can connect a camera, deploy a model like YOLO for object detection, and track multiple objects in real time without depending on cloud servers. Developers often use the Jetson Nano for robotics, drones, and AI-powered monitoring systems because it can process data on the spot and make decisions instantly. That ability to run advanced AI workloads on a device that fits in the palm of your hand makes it a huge leap for edge computing.</p>

    <p>This naturally connects to the bigger world of IoT, the Internet of Things. The idea behind IoT is that everyday devices, from thermostats to industrial sensors, are all connected, collecting and exchanging data. Edge devices like the Jetson Nano are critical here because sending all data to the cloud is inefficient, especially for applications where timing is crucial. Imagine a smart camera in a factory that needs to spot defects in products moving quickly along a conveyor belt. If it had to wait for cloud servers to analyze the frames, the delay would be unacceptable. Instead, the Jetson Nano can process those frames locally, flagging issues instantly and only sending essential data to the cloud for storage or further analysis. This same principle applies to smart homes, autonomous drones, or even city infrastructure. IoT is not just about collecting data, it is about making intelligent local decisions that improve efficiency and reduce reliance on central servers.</p>

    <p>Smart cameras are one of the best examples of how edge AI changes the game. With a Jetson Nano, a camera can do far more than record video. It can detect suspicious behavior for security systems, count people in a retail store for analytics, or monitor traffic flow in smart cities. Because the processing happens locally, these cameras can respond immediately, without the lag of cloud processing. In healthcare, similar systems can be used for patient monitoring, analyzing vital signs, or detecting abnormal patterns in scans. What excites me is that the same low-cost edge hardware can serve vastly different industries, adapting to the problem simply by changing the models and sensors attached to it.</p>

    <p>One of the most exciting real-world examples of this edge intelligence is Tesla’s self-driving system. Tesla cars are essentially rolling IoT devices loaded with cameras, radar, ultrasonic sensors, and onboard computers that process data in real time. Each car runs AI models locally to recognize road signs, detect pedestrians, track other vehicles, and make driving decisions in fractions of a second. While Tesla uses the cloud for over-the-air updates and to train its fleet-wide neural networks, the actual decision-making on whether to brake, accelerate, or steer has to happen at the edge, inside the car. This is the same principle as running a computer vision model on a Jetson Nano, but scaled up with powerful processors, redundant systems, and massive amounts of training data. For me, the fascinating part is how the journey progresses from experimenting with edge devices like Jetson Nano to seeing the same principles power something as advanced and world-changing as autonomous driving. It shows just how much edge computing has grown from niche projects into the backbone of real-world innovation.</p>
