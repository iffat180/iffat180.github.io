  excerpt: "React gives you freedom, Next.js gives you structure — knowing when to use each can make or break your project.",
  html: `
    <p>React is often the starting point for many front-end developers, and for good reason. At its core, React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It gives you the building blocks — components, hooks, and state management — to create fast, dynamic web apps. But React by itself does not care about routing, server-side rendering, or file structure. That flexibility is both a blessing and a curse: you can structure a React project however you want, but you also end up pulling in extra libraries for routing (like React Router), state management, or even SEO. For smaller projects or applications that only need client-side rendering, React works perfectly and gives you complete control over how things are set up.</p>

    <p>Next.js, on the other hand, takes React and supercharges it into a full-fledged framework. It comes with built-in routing, server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), API routes, and great support for SEO. That means if you are building something like an e-commerce store or a blog, Next.js can pre-render pages for speed and better search engine visibility. It also gives you the option to mix and match rendering strategies: some pages can be static, others can be server-rendered, and some can still be fully client-side. For teams or solo developers who want structure, performance, and scalability out of the box, Next.js feels like React with batteries included.</p>

    <p>From my own experience, I’ve noticed the choice often comes down to project needs. When I was first working on small projects, React gave me freedom to learn and experiment without too many rules. But as soon as I started thinking about portfolio blogs, dashboards, or anything that needed better SEO and routing, I saw why people love Next.js. It saves time on setup and handles so many things automatically, like image optimization and fast refresh. For me, React is like having a box of Lego bricks, where you can build anything if you bring your own instructions, while Next.js is like a Lego kit that comes with a manual, specialized pieces, and a finished model that actually works better in the real world. Knowing when to use each is less about which one is “better” and more about matching the tool to the job.</p>
